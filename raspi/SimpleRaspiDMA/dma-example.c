//-------- Relative offsets for DMA registers
//DMA Channel register sets (format of these registers is found in DmaChannelHeader struct):
#define DMACH(n) (0x100*(n))
//Each DMA channel has some associated registers, but only CS (control and status), CONBLK_AD (control block address), and DEBUG are writeable
//DMA is started by writing address of the first Control Block to the DMA channel's CONBLK_AD register and then setting the ACTIVE bit inside the CS register (bit 0)
//Note: DMA channels are connected directly to peripherals, so physical addresses should be used (affects control block's SOURCE, DEST and NEXTCONBK addresses).
#define DMAENABLE 0x00000ff0 //bit 0 should be set to 1 to enable channel 0. bit 1 enables channel 1, etc.

//flags used in the DmaChannelHeader struct:
#define DMA_CS_RESET (1<<31)
#define DMA_CS_ACTIVE (1<<0)

#define DMA_CB_TI_DEST_INC (1<<4)
#define DMA_CB_TI_SRC_INC (1<<8)

//set bits designated by (mask) at the address (dest) to (value), without affecting the other bits
//eg if x = 0b11001100
