 *
 * The general idea is to have a buffer of N blocks, where each block is the same size as the gpio registers, 
 *   and have the DMA module continually copying the data in this buffer into those registers.
 * In this way, we can have (say) 32 blocks, and then be able to buffer the next 32 IO frames.
 *
 * How is DMA transfer rate controlled?
 * We can use the DREQ (data request) feature.
 *   PWM supports a configurable data consumption clock (defaults to 100MHz)
 *   PWM (and SPI, PCM) can fire a DREQ signal any time its fifo falls below a certain point.
 *   But we are never filling the FIFO, so DREQ would be permanently high.
 *   Could feed PWM with dummy data, and use 2 DMA channels (one to PWM, one to GPIO, both gated), but the write-time to GPIOs may vary from the PWM, so gating may be improper
 * Or we can use the WAITS portion of the CB header. This allows up to 31 cycle delay -> ~25MHz?
 *   Will have to manually determine timing characteristics though.
 * Or use 2 dma channels:
 *   Have one sending the data into PWM, which is DREQ limited
 *   Have another copying from PWM Fifo to GPIOs at a non-limited rate. This is peripheral -> peripheral, so I think it will have its own data bus.
 *     Unfortunately, the destination can only be one word. Luckily, we have 2 PWM channels - one for setting & one for clearing GPIOs. All gpios that are broken out into the header are in the first register (verified)
 *   Sadly, it appears that the PWM FIFO cannot be read from. One can read the current PWM output, but only if the FIFO is disabled, in which case the DREQ is too.
 *
 **Or use 1 dma channel, but additionally write to a dreq-able peripheral (PWM):
 *   By using control-blocks, one can copy a word to the GPIOs, then have the next CB copy a word to the PWM fifo, and repeat
 *   By having BOTH control-blocks be dreq-limited by the PWM's dreq, they can BOTH be rate-limited.
 *   PWM clock works as so: 500MHz / clock_div = PWM_BITRATE (note: bitrate!)
 *     PWM_BITRATE / PWM_RNG1 = #of FIFO writes/sec
 *     Max PWM_BITRATE = 25MHz
 *   Also, dest_addr = 0x7e20b000 // the testbus interface which is a dump peripheral that goes nowhere (http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=7696&start=25 )
 *
 * DMA Control Block layout:
 *   repeat #srcBlock times:
 *     1.copy srcBlock to gpios
 *     2.zero srcBlock
 *     3.move byte to PWM (paced via DREQ)
 *   These are largely redundant; it may be possible to use less memory (each cb uses 32 bytes of memory)
 *
 * Problem: each "frame" is currently 6 words (but the last word is padding), and 1 PAGE_SIZE is not an integer multiple of 6*4
 *   Thus, the very last frame on each page cannot be used with DMA. Because of this, too, the virtual addressing of each frame is messed up - we must skip one frame per page.
 *   One solution is to append 2 more pad words to each frame (so that it is 8 words in length). This fixes all issues, but increases ram usage and potentially cache problems (L2 is 128KB). However, since data reads are sequential, even if all data doesn't fit in cache, it will be prefetched.
 *   Another solution is to decrease frame size to 4 words, and use 2 control blocks for each frame (thus eliminating the 1-byte padding in the center). This will have an even LARGER impact on ram usage - effectively using 20 words/frame vs current 14 words/frame & alternative 16words/frame
 *   Another solution is to directly mix src data with CB data. Each CB has 2 words of padding, and a data frame is 5 words, and each CB must be aligned to 8 words. Therefore, the following is possible, assuming each frame requires 3 CBs:
 *     CB1.1(padded) | CB1.2(padded) | CB1.3(padded) | CB2.1(padded) | CB2.2(padded) | CB2.3(unpadded) | SRC(5) | SRC(5) <- uses 56 words per 2 frames 
 *     HOWEVER, PAGE_SIZE is not an integral multiple of 56 words
 *     Although, 1 of those CBs (the one which zeros the previous source) could be shared amongst multiple frames - that is, only zero every, say, 4 frames. The effect is:
 *      *32 words for 1 frame  grouped (5  src words - 2 means pad to 8 words for src)
 *       48 words for 2 frames grouped (10 src words - 2 means pad to 8 words for src)
 *       72 words for 3 frames grouped (15 src words - 2 means pad to 16 words for src)
 *       96 words for 4 frames grouped (20 src words - 2 means pad to 24 words for src)
 *       112 words for 5 frames grouped(25 src words - 2 means pad to 24 words for src)
 *       136 words for 6 frames grouped(30 src words - 2 means pad to 32 words for src)
 *       160 words for 7 frames grouped(35 src words - 2 means pad to 40 words for src)
 *       176 words for 8 frames grouped(40 src words - 2 means pad to 40 words for src)
 *       200 words for 9 frames grouped(45 src words - 2 means pad to 48 words for src)
 *       216 words for 10frames grouped(50 src words - 2 means pad to 48 words for src)
 *       240 words for 11frames grouped(55 src words - 2 means pad to 56 words for src)
 *       264 words for 12frames grouped(60 src words - 2 means pad to 64 words for src)
 *    ...432 words for 20frames grouped(100src words - 2 means pad to 104 words for src)
 *   ...*512 words for 24frames grouped(120src words - 2 means pad to 120 words for src)
 *     As can be seen, this still requires extra padding. Could do 128 words for 5 frames, or 256 words for 11 frames (23.3 words/frame), and that requires funky math.
 *     The 24 frame option would work OK. 24 is a relatively easy number to work with, and 21.3 words/frame (limit is 21 words/frame)
 *    Another solution is to use the 2D stride functionality. The source frame is really 4 words and the destination is really 2 words, a 1 word gap, and then the other 2 words. Thus 2d stride can be used to skip over that one word gap.
 *
 *  How to determine the current source word being processed?
 *    dma header points to the physical CONBLOCK_AD. This can be linked to the virtual source address via a map.
 *    OR: STRIDE register is unused in 1D mode. Could write the src index that this block is linked to in that register. But then we can't use stride feature.
 *      Rather, we can't use the stride feature on ONE cb per frame. So, use stride on the buffer->GPIO cb, and use the stride register to indicate index on the zeros-copy and the PWM cb. Can tell which CB we're looking at based on the 2DEN flag. If we're looking at the buffer->GPIO cb, then instead look at NEXTCON_BK
 *    NOTE: if 2d stride is disabled, it appears that the DMA engine doesn't even load the STRIDE register (it's read as garbage). It may PERHAPS display the last loaded word.
 *    Note: unused fields are read as "Don't care", meaning we can't use them to store user-data.
 *
 * http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=26907
 *   Says gpu halts all DMA for 16us every 500ms. To bypass, add 'disable_pvt=1' to /boot/cmdline.txt
 * http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=7696&start=25
 *   Says it's possible to get access to a 250MHz clock.
 * How to make DMA more consistent (ie reduce bus contention?):
 *   disable interrupts 1 uS before any 'real' transaction, enable them afterwards
 *   Make sure dummy writes DON'T READ FROM RAM (ie, use src_ignore = 1)
 *   boot with disable_pvt=1 (prevents gpu from halting everything to adjust ram refresh rate twice per second) in /boot/cmdline.txt. Does this affect system stability?
